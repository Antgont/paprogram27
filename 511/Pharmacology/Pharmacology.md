Pharamacology- the science of substances (DRUGS) used to
- Treat Disease
- Diagnose Disease
- Prevent Disease
Most drugs interact with living systems through chemical processes
- Binding to regulatory molecules
- This interaction will activate or inhibit normal body processes
Toxicology- The science/study of the undesirable effects of chemicals on living systems

**ALL drugs have features of toxicology and pharmacology


Receptor Theory
- Mechanism of Action
- Types of Receptot
		- Ion Channel
			- NA+, K+, Ca++, CL-
			- Change the shape of the channel to icnrease or decrease permeability
		- Enzyme
			- Inhibit the production of compounds we dont want in body
				- uric acid
					- gout, kidney stones
			- Inhibit degradation of compounds we want to keep in the body
				- monoamines (dopamine, noepinephrine, epinephrine, serotonin)
		- Receptor for other substances
			- epinephrine and its compounds
			- transport protein
			- structural protein
			- nucleic acid
				-chemotherapy drugs, antibiotics 
Agonist- a drug that binds a receptor and creates a biologic response
Antagonist
- Types
	- Pharmacologic antagonist- Binds to a receptor without activating it, prevents other substance from binding
	- Chemical antagonist- counters the action of another drug by binding the drug and preventing it's actions
	- Mixed agonist/antagonist or partial agonist
- Competitive vs irreversible antagonist
	- Competitive- Binds and releases (competes with agonist)
	- Irreversible- Never lets go

Therapeutic Index
- Mathmatical calculation= LD 50/ ED 50
- LD should be large, and ED should be small
- Discovered through testing in laboratory animals
- Describe relatively safety of a drug
- Examples

Efficacy
- How effective is the drug? 
Potency
- How much of the drug do you need to take for it to have an effective
Therapeutic range
- Dose range: minimum effective dose up to the maximum tolerated dose
- Blood concentration
	- Of the parent medication
	- Metabolites
	- Biologic response to the medication

## Pharmacokinetics
- Drug motion
- Absorption
	- Active vs. Passive
		- B12 needs to be actively absorbed
			- intrinsic factor
	- Rate vs Extent of absorption
		- rate= how fast something is absorbed 
		- Extent= how much of something is absorbed
- Formulation Factors
	- Enteric coating
		- protects the drug from the body (acid-sensitive agent)
		- Protects the body from the drug (drug that's irritating to esophagus or stomach)
	- Delayed release
		- pH-dependent coating releases drug at specific point in the GI tract (acid labile drug or drug delivery to certain part of the GI tract)
	- Extended/Sustained/Controlled Release
		- Capsule/tablet released over a period of 8/12/24 hours
		- Multiple mechanisms exist to create this phenomenon
- Distribution
	- Concept
		- Where does the drug go?
		- Does the drug accumulate in certain compartments or tissues?
	- Protein binding
		- not found in bloodstream or other places? 
	- Albumin- the "bus" or carrier molecule
- One- compartment PK Model
	- ![[Pasted image 20250124120129.png]]
	- As drug is eliminated in the urine, metabolized by liver, or dumped into GI, the concentration of the drug goes down 
- Two- compartment PK Model
	- ![[Pasted image 20250124120717.png]]
	- Drugs go where they can go and as a result, it gets eliminated as it goes from the central compartment to the peripheral compartment
- Metabolism
	- Concept- drug modification
		- Termination of drug action- active drug to inactive metabolite
		- Drug activation- inactive drug to active metabolite
		- Conversion from active drug to active metabolite
		- pro drug
			- goes to liver, gets metabolized and then is also an active metabolite and then gets metabolized again as a platelet?? 
	- Oxidation/Reduction (phase 1)
		- Cytochrome p450
			- 1A2, 2D6, 2C9, 2C19, 3A4
		- multiple enzyme
		- Naturally occurring, not human made 
	- Conjugation (phase 2)
		- glucuronide, glycine, glutamine
		- elimination in the urine or stool
	- Enzyme induction
		- drug/enzyme increases activity of another drug/enzyme 
			- Pax-lovent (COVID 19 drug) causes inhibition/deactivation of other drugs/enzymes so as a result some individuals can't take it 
	- Enzyme inhibition
	- Half-life
		- How long it takes for half of the drug to be removed

First-Pass Effect
- Oral medications only; once absorbed, how much medication gets extracted and metabolized by the liver on first pass through
	- Lidocaine
- Prodrug
	- Compound by itself is inactive
	- Once administered, drug is activated through some metabolic process to yield active drug
	- Rationale: improve safety, improves bioavailability
	- Ex. Phenytoin vs fosphenytoin


Elimination Routes
- Urine
	- Unchanged
	- as metabolites
	- Both
- Stool
	- Unchanged
	- as metabolites
	- Both
- Exhalation

Drug Interactions
- Types
	- Drug-food
		- Influence absorption
			- Increase or Decrease Extent
			- Increase or Decrease Rate
		- Influence metabolism
			- Some foods slow the metabolism of other drugs
	- Drug-disease
	- Pharmacologic and pharmacodynamic
	- Pharmacokinetics 
- Absorption
	- Anything and alendronate (fosamax)
		- Virtual inhibition of absorption
		- Must be given on a completely empty stomach with plain water
	- Acid reducers and ketoconazole (Nizoral)
		- Requires acid to be absorbed, must avoid combination or pick alternative to Nizoral
	- Certain calcium salts and acid reducers
		- CaCO3 requires acid to be absorbed, must pick non-carbonate salt of calcium
- Distribution/Protein binding
	- Ibuprofen (Motrin) and warfarin (Coumadin)
		- IBU displaces WARF from albumin resulting in a transient increase in WARF levels
- Metabolism
- Elimination
	- probenecid and penicillin
- Mangement
	- Monitior
		- THIS DOES NOT MEAN DO NOTHING
	- Change one of the interacting drugs
	- Change the doses of the interacting drugs
	- Change the timing of administration of one drug

## Drug Adminstration
- Routes/Implications
	- Oral (PO)
		- Not all drugs can or should be given orally
		- Local effects (poorly absorbed)
		- Systemic effects (drugs that are absorbed)
		- Relatively inexpensive compared to perenteral formulation
		- Onset of action ranges from minutes to hours
		- Duration of action depends on product formulation and proterties of the drug
		- Solid, liquid, variations
	- Intravenous
		- Not all drugs can or should be given intravenous
		- Direct injection of undiulted or partial diluted drug
		- Onset is rapid
		- Duration depends on proeprties of the drug
		- ex. Morphine
	- Intramuscular (IM)
		- Not all drugs can or should be given intramuscularly
		- Injection in the muscle (deltoids, gluteus)
		- Relatively rapid onset
			- faster than oral
		- Duration mostly depend on properties of the drug, formulation may prolong absorption
		- Ex. morphine
	- Subcutaneous (SQ)
		- Not all drugs
		- Injection of solution or suspension into the fatty layer below the skin
		- Onset ranges from rapid to slow
		- Duration depends on production formulation and properties of the drug
		- Ex. insulin, erythropoietin
	- Piggyback (PB)
		- Bolus or intermittent (once daily, every 6 hours, every hour 1) of drug in 25-500 ml of solution
		- For drugs that need to be diluted or given over a longer period of time
		- onset usually rapid as drug is given intravenously
		- Duration depends on properties of the drug
		- ex.
			- potassium chloride must be diluted and given 10-20meQ/hr
			- Most IV antibiotics
	- Continous Infusion
		- Several hours' worth of drugs are mixed in IV and given by pump or similar device
		- Reliable constant serum concentration= double the dose is equal to double serum concentration
		- Onsent usually rapid, bolus dose almost always given first
		- Duration is forever as long as the drip is running once the drip is off duration depends on properties of the drug
		- Generally for drugs taht have a short half-life would require frequent adminstration
		- Ex.
			- insulin infusion for diabetic ketoacidosis
			- Morphine infusion for intractable cancer pain
	- Sublingual (SL)
		- sub=under
		- lingual= tongue
		- Nitroglycerin
		- Certain anticholinergic drugs to dry secretion
	- Rectal (PR)
		- Useful for patient who are vomiting or can't swallow
		- Useful for local disease
			- Acetaminophen suppositories
	- Transdermal
		- Patches
		- Ointment, cream
		- Once per day, once every 3 days, once per week
			- Estradiol patches, nitroglycerin patches
	- Nasal/intranasal

		- Steroids
		- Other anti-inflammatory drugs
	- Intra-osseous
