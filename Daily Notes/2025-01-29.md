Another day, I really hope that I really lock in the next two weeks. I can't believe we have 4 exams in like one week how crazy is that. My sleep was so ass this morning I had a crazy dream where me and katie ended up like killing someone but they attacks us first but no one knows they did so we were like trying to figure that out. Anyways, I started putting time slots into my gcal so I can hopefully partiation my time into different classes
