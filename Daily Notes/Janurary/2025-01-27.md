Welp today is a pretty light day in terms of class work but that just means it's more time for me to catch up in clin med!! I feel like it honestly seems a little bit more manageable, I talked with some of the upperclassmen last night about the exams for clin med and st uff and they reassured me with the fact that they usually drop some buzzwords about what illness it is so that helps a lot. I was super worried that they would essentially just throw like vague sick symptoms and tell us to guess so that's a lot better.
