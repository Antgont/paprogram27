**Yersinia pestis**  [[G-]] rod/coccobacillus
Highly virulent (ID50 1–10 organisms) 

- Endemic in wild rodents
	- Southwestern/Western US
	- South America, Africa, Asia 
# Transmission
Fleas transmit infection between rodents
Prairie dogs MC reservoir in US
Human transmission by:
- Flea bite
- Direct contact w/ animal tissues/fluids
- Respiratory droplets in plague [[pneumonia]] Plague
# Signs and Symptoms
Bubonic (80-95%) vs. Pneumonic

<u>Bubonic plague</u>
- **Sudden** onset [[F]]/C, weakness, HA
- ==Regional lymph node pain/swelling (inguinal LNs common) -Buboes==
- Untreated cases can progress to [[sepsis]], 2/2 pneumonic plague
<u>Pneumonic plague</u>
- Primary –inhaled secretions/aerosolized droplets from infected human or animal
- Secondary
# Diagnosis
Smear/cx of blood or bubo pus is preferred
# Treatment
Low index of suspicion for timely treatment!
- **Aminoglycoside** ([[streptomycin]] or [[gentamicin]])
- [[Doxycycline]] or tetracycline are good alternatives
- Post-exposure ppx recommended for close contacts
# Prognosis
Poor if untreated = bubonic (50-90%); pneumonic (~100%)
