## Information 
- Main Cause of tick-borne and vector-bone disease
- Borrelia Burgdorferi
- B. Mayonni (upper Midwest)
## Patho
- Infection spreads from bite through blood to organs
## Cause

Transmission: Tick Bite
	- Ixodes Scapularis- Midwest and NOrtheast
		- Lyme, human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, babesiosis
	- Ixodes Pacificus- West Coast
- Tick Nymphs main cause of transmitting disease
## Symptoms
- Peaks in Mid May to June
- Onset of Disease June to August
	- ==Must feed for 36-48 hours or more to transmit==
- **Stage 1 (Early Localized)**
	- 3-30 days post bite
	- **Erythema Migrans
		- target/ bull's eyes in 80% of presentations
	- Painless and nonprutic
	- Nonspecific flu-like Sx
	- 25% of cases don't have rash nor remember bite
- **Stage 2 (Early Disseminated)**
	- weeks to months later
	- Myocarditis
	- aseptic [[meningitis]]
	- Ball's Palsy
		- Droopy unilateral appearance, includes forehead
	- Other Neuro Sx
	- Followed by latent phases
- **Stage 3 (Late Disseminated)**
	- months and years later
	- Large joint arthritis
	- Encephalopathy

## Diagnosis
- [[ELISA]] to detect IgM or IgG
	- Antibody depends on length of infection
	- Risk of false negative if done 2 weeks before infection
	- Positive [[ELISA]] needs western blot to confirm
## Treatment
- Early Localized
	- [[Doxycycline]]
	- Amoxicillin
	- [[Cefuroxime]]
- Early Disseminated
	- [[Doxycycline]]
	- [[Ceftriaxone]]
- Late or Severe
	- IV [[Ceftriaxone]]
