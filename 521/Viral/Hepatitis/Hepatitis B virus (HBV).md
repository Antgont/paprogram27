## Information 
- DNA, Non-enveloped
	- replicates like RNA virus
- Hepadnavirus
- Important virus to know
	- >250-300 million worldwide chronically infected
	- 800,000 deaths annually d/t liver disease
		- Cirrhosis
		- Liver Failure
		- Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
- 
## Cause
- Transmission: Blood, needle stick, transfusion, IV drug abuse
- Sexual contact
- From mother during birth
## Symptoms
- Incubation: avg 90 days (60-150 days)


## Diagnosis
- Markers for Hep B
	- Coat protein HBsAG (surface antigen)
		- Protein in HBV envelope
		- Produced during active infections
			- presence includes transmission rate
		- Chronic carrier: HBsAG detected >6 months
	- Anti-HBc IgM antibodies
		- Diagnostic of acute disease
	- Anti-HBc IgG antibodies
		- Diagnostic of chronic disease
	- Anti-HBs antibody (HBsAb) is protective
		- Neuralizes HBsAG --> Immunity
		- Not detectable in chronic infections
	- 
	- Core (HBcAG) (Some structural functionality, indicator of true infection)
	- HBeAg marker of infectivity
		- Presence increases transmission rate 
- Serum HBV DNA [[PCR]] test

## Pathogenesis
- Hepatitis results from T cell mediated immune response
- Inadequate immune response leads to chronic infection
- Chronic infection associated with cirrhosis and HCC

## Treatment 
- mostly symptomatic for acute HBV; antiviral for chronic infections
- Entecavir (Baraclude) or tenofovir (Viread, Vemlidy); other options like PegIFN
Hepatitis B [[vaccine]]
- Recombinant DNA [[vaccine]] of surface antigen
- Universal vaccination of newborns – 0, 1, 6 months
- High risk populations:
	- Health care workers 
	- Hemodialysis patients
	- Babies of infected mothers
	- IV Drug abusers
- Post-exposure [[prophylaxis]] with HBV immune globulin + HBV vaccine if unvaccinated
Universal blood precautions
- Assume all patients are infected – Wear gloves, etc.
