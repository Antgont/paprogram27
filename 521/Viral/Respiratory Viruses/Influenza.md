## Information 
 Orthomyxovirus family (segmented genome)
- Enveloped RNA
- Fever Types
	- ==**Influenza A-> Major outbreak and pademic==**
	- ==**Influenza B--> Major outbreaks**==
	- Influenza C + D (C is common cold)
- Envelope spike proteins (key antiviral targets)
	- Hemagglutinin
		- Bind to the cell surface receptor
	- Neuraminidase
		- Cleaves neuraminic acid (sialic acid) to release progeny virus
- ==[[H1N1]] and H3n2 strains of Influenza A== 
- Influenza- A Antigenic Variability
	- Antigenic drift
		- Minor changes (mutation) in HA and NA causing local out breaks
	- Antigenic shift
		- Major antigenic changes result in reassortment of genomes; new HA and/or HA and NA
## Cause
- Transmitted by airborne respiratory droplets
## Symptoms
- 24-48 hours
	- [[F]]
	- Myalgias
	- HA
	- Sore throat
	- Cough
## Diagnosis
- Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Test (RIDT)
- [[PCR]]
## Treatment 
- Neuraminidase inhibitor
	- [[Oseltamivir]] (Tamiflu) oral
	- [[Zanamivir]] (Relenza) intranasal
- Ppx: Killed vs live attenuated vaccine 

Avian Influenza Virus (H5N1)
- Influenza A/Hong Kong/ 1997 (H5N1)
- Mire virulent than typical strains
	- 60% mortality from ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome)
- Transmission from chicken to humans
	- No doucmenated human to human transmission
