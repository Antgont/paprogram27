## Fungal infections = [[Mycoses]]
**Mycoses** 
- Superficial 
	- → Typically non-invasive → “cutaneous” 
		- (skin, hair, nail, mucosa (thrush, vaginitis) and “subcutaneous”
	- [[Cutaneous Mycoses]]
	- [[Sporotrichosis]]

# Cutaneous [[Mycoses]]: molds (dermatophytes) 

### The Organisms:
- Trichophyton 
- Microsporum 
- Epidermophyton 
### The Host:
- Healthy children and adults 
- Males>>Females 
### Pathogenesis
- Live in epidermis, hair follicles, nails
- Rarely deeper infection
- Symptoms are caused by hypersensitivity reaction to fungi 

- Dermatophytes cause clinical disease call “tineas” (tineas = mean worm-like)
	- Tinea capitis
	- Tinea corporis (ringworm)
	- Tinea cruris
	- Tinea pedis (athletes foot) 
	- Tinea unguium (onychomycosis) 
### Diagnosis
Mostly clinical
### Treatment 
- Creams and lotions
- Oral azoles for nails
