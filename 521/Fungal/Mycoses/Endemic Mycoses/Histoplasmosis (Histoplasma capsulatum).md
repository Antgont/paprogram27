## The Organism
Dimorphic (mold at 25oC, yeast at 37oC) 
Geographically restricted
## The Host
- Healthy children and adults
- Immunocompromised
	- Pts get worse disease 
	- Major patient groups affected?
		- HIV
		- Tx Recipients
		- Steroid Rx
		- TNF Inhibitors
## Epidemiology
- Mississippi & Ohio River valleys primary site
- Grows in the soil, old buildings, caves
- Growth enhanced with high nitrogen content
	- (bird droppings, bat guano)
- Humans inhale conidia from environment
- Point source outbreaks (e.g.: Michigan, Indiana)
## Pathogenesis (similar to Tuberculosis)
- Present in the environment as a mold
- Inhalation of conidia into alveoli → yeasts
- Spread to local lymph nodes
- Silent hematogenous spread to reticuloendothelial system (RES)
- Immune response is sensitized → T-lymphocytes and activated macrophages (CMI) allowing killing of the yeast
- BUT, residual organisms can reactivate years later if CMI wanes

## Clinical Disease
- [[Pulmonary histoplasmosis]]
	- ==Acute==, looks like typical [[CAP]], but with hilar lymphadenopathy
	- ==Chronic== cavitary, mimics Tb, mostly older patients with COPD
- [[Disseminated histoplasmosis]]
	- Usually immune compromised host; involves lung, marrow, liver, spleen, adrenals, GI tract, etc. often fatal
