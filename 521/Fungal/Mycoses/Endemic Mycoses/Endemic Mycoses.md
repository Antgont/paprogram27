## Characteristics
- True pathogens-infect healthy people 
- Geographically restricted Environmental source 
	- NOT person to person
- Dimorphic: mold at 25oC, yeast at 37oC 
- Most grow slowly & with difficulty in lab 
- Cell-mediated immune response most important

## Main Features
- Geographically restricted
- Environmental source
- True pathogens-infect healthy people
- Dimorphic fungi: mold at 25oC, yeast at 37oC 
	- [[Histoplasmosis (Histoplasma capsulatum)]] 
	- [[Blastomycosis (Blastomyces dermatitidis)]]
	- [[Coccidioidomycosis (Coccidioides immitis)]]
- Most grow slowly & with difficulty in lab

## Diagnosis
- [[Culture]]
- Antigen detection
- Antibody
- [[Histopathology]]
## Treatment 
- [[Amphotericin]] B if **severe disseminated** disease (IV)
- Azole (often [[Itraconazole]]) if less severe
- Treat for months to years to lifetime (cocci CNS)
