## The Organism (Candida albicans, Candida glabrata)
- Many, but few main ones part of human microbiota in mouth, gut, vagina, skin
## The Host
- Key on spectrum of disease
- Immunocompetent host
	- Skin and mucous membrane infection
- Immunocompromised host
	- Severe mucous membrane infection /disseminated infection
		- Solid Organ transplant recipients
		- Heme malignancy/stem cell transplant recipients (chemoRx, neutropenia)
		- ICU patients with many risk factors

## Epidemiology

## Pathogenesis
- Overgrowth in area in which yeast normally present
- Gain access to blood through central catheter
	- candidemia
- With immune suppression, especially neutropenia, escape from normal niche in gut and spread through bloodstream
	- candidemia

## Clinical Disease
[[Thrush]]
Rash (disseminated candidiasis)

## Diagnosis
- [[Culture]] - easy and rapid (1-2 days)
- Blood, body fluids
- (must separate colonization from infection)
- [[Histopathology]]; smears/stains of lesions
## Treatment
- **[[Echinocandins]]** - [[Micafungin]], others
	- 1st line for candidemia, invasive candidiasis (empiric treatment)
- Azoles â€“ mostly [[Fluconazole]]
- [[Amphotericin]] B - only if needed
