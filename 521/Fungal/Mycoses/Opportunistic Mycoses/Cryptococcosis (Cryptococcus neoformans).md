 [[Opportunistic Mycoses]]
## The Organism (Cryptococcus neoformans)
- Environmental [[Yeast]]
- Has a huge <u>polysaccharide capsule</u>
	- Helps with pathogenesis and diagnosis (antigen -> capsule)
- Found in soil, on decaying wood, in tree hollows, or in **bird droppings**.
- Encapsulated budding yeast on India ink preparation
## The Host
- Most patients immunocompromised (T cells)
	- [[HIV]] and SOT
- Highest risk group – [[HIV]] with low CD4’s (<200)
- In Africa 2nd most common cause of death in persons with [[HIV]]
	- Being TB the 1rst cause of death
- Healthy adults can get this infection
## Epidemiology

## Pathogenesis
1. Yeast inhaled into alveoli from environment
2. Capsule impedes phagocytosis
3. Spreads through bloodstream to CNS (neurotropic)

## Clinical Disease
- Pulmonary disease - often without Sx
- [[Meningitis]] primary manifestation – subacute disease
- Disseminated disease with marked immune compromise
## Diagnosis
- [[Culture]] - easy to grow
- India ink – see the yeast in CSF (highlights capsule)
	- Looking for **encapsulated budding yeast**
- Antigen detection-extremely useful
- Antibody – no use
## Treatment
- Induction therapy: Liposomal [[Amphotericin]] B + [[flucytosine]] induction therapy
- Consolidation therapy: [[Fluconazole]] 
- Tx usually 1 year or longer
