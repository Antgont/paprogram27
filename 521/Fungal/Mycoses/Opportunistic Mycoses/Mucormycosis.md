[[Fungi]], [[Mold]], [[Opportunistic Mycoses]]
## The Organism (Rhizopus, Mucor)
- Many species, but few major ones:
- Rhizopus (bread mold), Mucor
- Ubiquitous in air, water, decomposing materials
- In-vitro: “fuzzy” colonies with aerial sporangia
- In-vivo: wide, non-septate hyphae invading tissue
## The Host
Almost entirely in immunocompromised OR
 persons with diabetes with poor glucose control

## Epidemiology

## Pathogenesis
- Conidia inhaled into lungs or sinuses
- PMNs and macrophages main defense
- Spreads locally across tissue planes and causes tissue infarction

## Clinical Disease
- Acute, severe, life-threatening infection
- Pulmonary disease resembles [[aspergillosis]] on CT
- ==Rhino-sino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis occurs mostly in persons with diabetes==
- Cutaneous infection shows **black necrotic lesions** 

## Diagnosis
- Very difficult
	- Needs high suspicion and tissue
- CT scan chest suggestive
- [[Culture]] +/- help
- Antibody – not available
- Antigen – not available
- ==[[Histopathology]] extremely useful==: broad non-septate hyphae invading tissues

## Treatment
- **Surgery** and **IV [[Amphotericin]] B**
- Azoles for stepdown therapy (posaconazole, [[isavuconazole]])

Can be fatal
