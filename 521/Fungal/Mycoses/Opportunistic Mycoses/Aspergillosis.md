## The Organism (Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus)
- Hundreds of species, but few major ones
	- Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus
- “fuzzy” colonies with aerial hyphae and conidia
- Transparent mold

In vivo: **septate hyphae** invading tissue
## The Host
Almost entirely in immunocompromised patients
 - Mainly neutropenia, steroids, chemoRx

## Epidemiology
- Ubiquitous in air, water, decomposing materials
## Pathogenesis

## Clinical Disease
- Acute severe life-threatening disease
- Pulmonary disease prominent
- Disseminates widely, including brain
- Tissue infarction the hallmark

## Diagnosis
- CT scan chest very suggestive
- [[Culture]] – easy
- Antibody - no use
- Antigen - galactomannan (cell wall component)
- [[Histopathology]] very useful, but…can’t be done in most patients (low platelet count)
## Treatment
- Azoles - [[voriconazole]], [[isavuconazole]] (1st line)
- [[Amphotericin]] B – (2nd line)

- [[Echinocandins]] - [[Micafungin]], others (last resort)
