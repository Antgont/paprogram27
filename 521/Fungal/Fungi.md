KINGDOM FUNGI:
- Eukaryotes*, no chlorophyll, non-motile
- NOT plants
- <<1% known fungi are human pathogens
- Essential role in the ecosystem by breaking down dead matter

# [[Mold]]
**Hyphae**: branching elongated structures that grow outward from the tip
**Conidia (spores):** are produced on tips or sides of hyphae serve reproductive function and allow transmission

# [[Yeast]]
- Small oval cells - reproduce by budding

## Important Characteristics of Fungi that Cause Human Infection
- <u>Eukaryotes</u> so share many components with our cells; 
	- Making treatment more complicated than bacteria
- <u>Sterols</u> in cell membrane, 
	- Important antifungal target, but similar to those of mammals, so drugs can be toxic
- <u>Cell wall has chitin</u>, ==glucans==, important antifungal targets; 
	- Mammals do not have cell walls, so safer drugs

# Fungal infections = [[Mycoses]]
**Mycoses** 
- Superficial 
	- → Typically non-invasive → “cutaneous” 
		- (skin, hair, nail, mucosa (thrush, vaginitis) and “subcutaneous”
	- [[Cutaneous Mycoses]]
	- [[Sporotrichosis]]
- Invasive 
	- → Disseminated 
		- (affecting deep organs: lungs, brain, spleen, liver, lymph nodes, esophagous, and skin as a manifestation of disseminated dz)

# [[Endemic Mycoses]]
### Types
- [[Histoplasmosis (Histoplasma capsulatum)]] 
- [[Blastomycosis (Blastomyces dermatitidis)]]
- [[Coccidioidomycosis (Coccidioides immitis)]]
# [[Opportunistic Mycoses]]
### Types
- [[Cryptococcosis (Cryptococcus neoformans)]]
- [[Candidiasis (Candida albicans, galbrata)]]
- [[Aspergillosis]]
- [[Mucormycosis]]
- [[Pneumocystosis]]
