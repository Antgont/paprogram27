- Worldwide, but higher prevalence in warmer climates
	- 20-30% of people in tropical regions
	- 5% in temperate regions)
- Higher risk if in endemic area >1 month

## Life Cycle 
- Cyst in environment deposited in feces; can persist wks-months w/o host
- Ingested by human host → transforms in small bowel → cysts
- E histolytica ingests RBCs
- ==**CAN ENTER LIVER**==

## Diagnosis 
- Stool positive for organisms that ingested RBC
- [[PCR]]
- Stool Antigen
- Serology (can be post for years)
- Liver Abscess
	- Avoid Aspiration
	- Serologies, treatment as diagnosis

## Treatment 
- Asymptomatic- Paromomycin or Iodoquinol
	- Carrier 
- Symptomatic
	- [[521/Antibiotics/Other Antibiotics/Metronidazole]] THEN Paromomycin or Iodoquinol
		- Iodoquinol (second step stops continued intraluminal infection)
