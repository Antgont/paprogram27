	- Legs are strongest muscle--> feet support that 
- Infective (filariform) larvae are up to 600 um long, live in soil
- Worldwide: tropical, subtropical, temperate (summer). Often rural regions.
- Higher risk in places with disparities in access to sanitation
- Soil transmitted helminth: ==walking bare feet== 

## Clinical Presentation (4)
- Acute
	- +/- Pruritic rash at site of pen

	- \+/- [[diarrhea]], constipation, and pain, anorexia when first enter GI tract
- Chronic
	- Usually asymptomatic
	- 75% have mild eosinophilia, Elevated IgE
- Hyper Infection
	- Risk Factors:
		- High-dose steroids, Aids, other immunosuppression
	- Hyper infection
		- Accelerated auto infection
			- Large # migrating larvae overwhelm system
- Disseminated Disease
	- Larvae disseminated beyond GI tract/lungs
		- GI- Abd pain, N/V/D, ileus or intestinal obstruction, mucosal ulceration â†’ hemorrhage, peritonitis Recurrent Gram neg bacteremia from larvae carrying bacteria thru mucosa
		- Pulm- Cough, wheeze, dyspnea, horseness, hemoptysis, respiratory failure
		- Derm- Larva currens (serpiginous or urticarial rash that moves quickly)
		- Neuro- Can find larva in CNS

## Diagnosis 
- Stool O&P (multiple) --> Larvae
- Serology (can't tell current from prior infection)
	- Before transplant 80%)
- Occasionally find a larvae in sputum

## Treatment 
- Depends on clinical presentation and severity
- Agents Used
	- 1st line- [[Ivermectin]]
