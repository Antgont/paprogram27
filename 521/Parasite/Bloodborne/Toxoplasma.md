- It is caused by the intracellular protozoan: Toxoplasma gondii
- In US it is estimated that 11% of people ≥6y have been infected
- Humans can be infected by
	- Eating raw/undercooked meat with tissue cysts (pork, lamb)
	- Water/food contaminated with oocysts
	- Congenital infection (pregnant person with 1o infection)
	- transfusion/organ transplantation
- Mainly impact immuncompromised patients
## Life Cycle 
- ==Cats are Primary Host==
	- Shed oocytes in feces
		- Remain viable for 18M in soil
	- oocytes are ingested by intermediate hosts
		- Invades, spreads, and forms tissue cysts
- Humans and other mammals are intermediate hosts
- Tissue Cysts
	- CNS; eyes; Skeletal/Smooth/Cardiac Muscle

## Clinical
- Healthy- asymptomatic (80-90%)
- Mild/Acute- Non-tender cervical LAD (lymphadenopathy), [[F]], Malaise, Myalgias, Night Sweats
- Ocular- Uveitis (healthy hosts), Chorioretinitis (pain, vision loss)
- Immunocompromised (AIDS Especially)
	- Encephalitis: multiple neurologic sx (inc focal findings); often presents as multiple brain lesions
	- Pneumonitis: fever, cough, dyspnea.
	- Myocarditis
	- Immunocompromised, AIDS, transplant
	- Pregnancy
		- Infected before becoming pregnant: fetus protected
		- Newly infected during or just before pregnancy, can pass infection → congenital transmission: fetal loss, severe CNS manifestations

## Diagnosis 
- [[PCR]]  of relevant fluids
- [[Serology]] (only tells possiblity of being exposed)
- [[Histopathology]] (organism in tissue)

## Treatment 
- Mild disease- supportive care (unless pregnant)
- Treatment targets tachyzoite stage
- **Pryimethamine + Sulfadiazine+ Leucovorin (folinic acid)
	- Pyrimethamine is the most effective treatment, but it is a folic acid antagonist. Therefor it requires Leuvororin to be utilizied
