5 Species of Plasmodium
	P. falciparum (most severe) 
	P. vivax (relapsing)
	P. ovale (relapsing)
	P. malariae (chronic infections)
	P. knowlesi (zoonotic
At Risk
- People with no or little immunity
	- Children,  Pregnant, Travelers
- People heavily exposed to P. falciparum
- People living in rural areas who lack access to healthcare

Incubation: 7-30 days
Categories: Uncomplicated or Severe (compilated)
Cause of symptoms- asexual erythrocytic or blood-stage parasites (when parasites are reproduced)
- Periodic malaria Paroxysms
- Stages of cold, hot, sweating


Uncomplicated
- Every two days with tertian parasites
	- P. falciparum
	- P. vivax
	- P. ovale
- Every three days with quartan [[parasite]] 
	- P. malariae
Severe
- Cerebral malaria
	- Effects CNS
		- Abnormal Behaviour, AMS, seiziure, coma
- Shock
- [[Jaundice]]
- Abnormal Spontaneous bleeding
- Pulm Edema, Resp Failure, ARDS

## Diagnosis of Malaria
- Microscopy
	- P. falciparum is most important!! Severe
	- Gametocyte has a distinct banana shape 
- Rapid Diagnostic Test
	- Similar to COVID-19
- Nucleic Amplification Test
	- [[PCR]]

## Treatment
- Severity
- Plasmodium Species
- Origin in the World
	- Chloroquine Resistance
- Uncomplicated, No Resistance
	- Chloroquine, hydroxoychlorquine
- Uncomplicated P falciparium & chloroquine-resistance P vivax,
	-Artemether/lumefantrine (Coartem), Atovaquone-proguani
- Severe
	- ==IV artesunate (obtained from CDC)==
- Sometimes Add Primaquine for P ovale, P vivax
	- Eliminates dormant organisms (hypnozoites) in livers. Prevents relapse
	- Check G6PD levels
- **Depends on species and severity of symptoms**

## Preventions
- Chemoprophylaxis (meds)
- Avoid mosquito bites
	- EPA insect repellents
		- DEET
	- Bed nets
	- Permethrin Spray
	- Vaccine
